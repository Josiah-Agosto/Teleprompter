# Teleprompter
Simple application that takes user generated text, either a Speech, Essay, or Script to visualize it in sections and Record Audio while presenting. The application persist data using Core Data and is visually seen in a Collection View. I encourage others to give their input on what can be better in terms of the Architecture and Design of my Code. Screenshots of the Application will be coming soon.
